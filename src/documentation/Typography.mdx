description: For consistent typography throughout the application we created a variety of Text components, you can read more about those specific font styles in the Text Component documentation.

## Fonts

<TypographyFamilies families={theme.fonts} css={{ mb: '$5' }} />

## Sizes

This typographic sizing scale represents the font-size values used in our components, it follows the Perfect Fourth scale and can be accessed by using t-shirt notation

<TypographyScale scale={theme.fontSizes} css={{ mb: '$5' }} />

An important thing to note is that most of our typography components, `Text`, `Heading`, `Label` and others, use [capsize](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) to offset the white-space between the cap-height and the line-height. This means that spacing in and around our text will be tight to the characters.

```jsx preview
<Box css={{ bg: '$primary200', p: '$4' }}>
  <Text size="lg" css={{ bg: 'white' }}>
    Hello World
  </Text>
</Box>
```
